# ML_model_on_twitter_gender_classification
This was my mini/minor project from a private company(https://www.verzeo.in/)

This data set was used to train a CrowdFlower AI gender predictor. You can read all about the project here. Contributors were asked to simply view a Twitter profile and judge whether the user was a male, a female, or a brand (non-individual). The dataset contains 20,000 rows, each with a user name, a random tweet, account profile and image, location, and even link and sidebar color.

The data can be downloaded from kaggle.

#The Data Description

The dataset contains the following fields: 

_unit_id: a unique id for user
_golden: whether the user was included in the gold standard for the model; TRUE or FALSE
_unit_state: state of the observation; one of finalized (for contributor-judged) or golden (for gold standard observations)
_trusted_judgments: number of trusted judgments (int); always 3 for non-golden, and what may be a unique id for gold standard observations
_last_judgment_at: date and time of last contributor judgment; blank for gold standard observations
gender: one of male, female, or brand (for non-human profiles)
gender:confidence: a float representing confidence in the provided gender
profile_yn: "no" here seems to mean that the profile was meant to be part of the
dataset but was not available when contributors went to judge it
profile_yn:confidence: confidence in the existence/non-existence of the profile
created: date and time when the profile was created
description: the user's profile description
fav_number: number of tweets the user has favorited
gender_gold: if the profile is golden, what is the gender?
link_color: the link color on the profile, as a hex value
name: the user's name
profile_yn_gold: whether the profile y/n value is golden
profileimage: a link to the profile image
retweet_count: number of times the user has retweeted (or possibly, been retweeted)
sidebar_color: color of the profile sidebar, as a hex value
text: text of a random one of the user's tweets
tweet_coord: if the user has location turned on, the coordinates as a string with the format "[latitude, longitude]"
tweet_count: number of tweets that the user has posted
tweet_created: when the random tweet (in the text column) was created
tweet_id: the tweet id of the random tweet
tweet_location: location of the tweet; seems to not be particularly normalized
user_timezone: the timezone of the user
