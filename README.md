# ML_model_on_twitter_gender_classification
This was my major project from a private company(https://www.verzeo.in/)

This data set was used to train a CrowdFlower AI gender predictor. Contributors were asked to simply view a Twitter profile and judge whether the user was a male, a female, or a brand (non-individual). The dataset contains 20,000 rows, each with a user name, a random tweet, account profile and image, location, and even link and sidebar color.

The data can be downloaded from kaggle.
